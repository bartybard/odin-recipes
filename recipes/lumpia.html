    <p> Filipino pork lumpia, or lumpiang shanghai, is a beloved Filipino   
        dish characterized by its delectable blend of flavors. These slender 
        spring rolls feature a savory filling of minced pork, carrots, onions, 
        and seasonings, wrapped in a thin, crispy shell. When deep-fried to a  
        golden perfection, they become a delightful, finger-friendly treat. 
        Served with a tangy dipping sauce made from vinegar, soy sauce, and 
        garlic, these lumpia are a culinary delight, perfect for sharing with 
        family and friends, and a beloved staple in Filipino cuisine.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken or pork</li>
        <li>½ cup green onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 can (8 ounces) water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, peeled and shredded</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>20 pieces spring roll wrappers</li>
        <li>canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine ground chicken, green onions, water chestnuts, carrots, garlic, soy sauce, salt, and pepper until well distributed.</li>
        <li>Separate wrappers into individual sheets and lay on a flat working surface.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon of meat mixture on the lower end of the wrapper, closest to you.</li>
        <li>Fold the bottom of wrapper over filling and continue to roll tightly into a thin log about ¾-inch thick. Wet the remaining edge of the wrapper with a dab of water to completely seal.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining mixture. Using scissors, cut each lumpia roll into about 3-inch lengths.</li>
        <li>In a pan over medium heat, heat about 2-inch deep of oil. Add lumpia in batches and cook turning on sides as needed, for about 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown and crisp and meat is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon or tongs, remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Serve immediately with sweet and sour sauce or banana ketchup.</li>
    </ol>
