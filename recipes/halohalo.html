    <h1>Halo-halo</h1>
    <img src="../images/halohalo.jpg" alt="sweet sweet halo-halo.">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Halo-halo is a beloved Filipino dessert that translates to "mix-mix"
        in Tagalog, and it's a true culinary delight. A delightful medley 
        of textures and flavors, it features a sweet concoction of crushed
        ice, jellies, fruits, sweet potato, and various beans, all crowned
        with a scoop of purple yam ice cream. Topped with a drizzle of leche 
        flan, shaved coconut, and a sprinkle of toasted rice crisps, Halo-halo 
        is a symphony of tastes that encapsulates the Philippines' rich culinary 
        diversity and its enduring love for sweet treats.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 cups of shaved or crushed ice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sweetened jackfruit (langka)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sweetened banana (saba)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sweetened sweet potato (kamote)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sweetened red kidney beans</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sweetened garbanzo beans</li>
        <li>1/4 cup nata de coco (coconut jelly)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sago (tapioca pearls)</li>
        <li>1 slice of leche flan (caramel custard)</li>
        <li>1-2 scoops of ube (purple yam) ice cream</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons of kaong (sugar palm fruit)</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons of macapuno (sweetened coconut sport strings)</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons of pinipig (toasted rice flakes)</li>
        <li>Evaporated milk, to taste (generally 2-4 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Sugar, to taste (generally 1-2 tablespoons)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine ground chicken, green onions, water chestnuts, carrots, garlic, soy sauce, salt, and pepper until well distributed.</li>
        <li>Separate wrappers into individual sheets and lay on a flat working surface.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon of meat mixture on the lower end of the wrapper, closest to you.</li>
        <li>Fold the bottom of wrapper over filling and continue to roll tightly into a thin log about Â¾-inch thick. Wet the remaining edge of the wrapper with a dab of water to completely seal.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining mixture. Using scissors, cut each lumpia roll into about 3-inch lengths.</li>
        <li>In a pan over medium heat, heat about 2-inch deep of oil. Add lumpia in batches and cook turning on sides as needed, for about 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown and crisp and meat is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon or tongs, remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Serve immediately with sweet and sour sauce or banana ketchup.</li>
    </ol>
